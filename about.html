        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Gym++ was founded in 2025 as a semester project by three Computer Science students. What started as a code project turned into a passion for creating a real community space. Located near HITEC University, we recognized the need for an affordable yet high-quality fitness center for students.</p>
